1. Reverse a String  
   - Take a string input from the user and reverse it using Java logic.  
   - Example: Input: "hello" → Output: "olleh"

2. Check if a String is Palindrome  
   - Determine whether a given string reads the same forwards and backwards.  
   - Example: "madam" → Palindrome, "hello" → Not Palindrome

3. Print Fibonacci Series  
   - Print the first 'n' numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.  
   - Sequence starts with 0, 1 and each next number is the sum of the previous two.

4. Prime Number Check  
   - Check if the number entered by the user is a prime number.  
   - A prime number has exactly 2 factors: 1 and itself (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7...)

5. Factorial Using Recursion  
   - Calculate the factorial of a number using a recursive method.  
   - Example: 5! = 5×4×3×2×1 = 120

6. Armstrong Number Check (3-digit)  
   - Check if a 3-digit number is an Armstrong number.  
   - A number is Armstrong if sum of cubes of its digits equals the number itself.  
   - Example: 153 = 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153

7. Swap Two Numbers Without Temp Variable  
   - Swap two integer values input by the user without using a third (temp) variable.  
   - Use arithmetic operations to do this trick.

8. Find GCD of Two Numbers  
   - Find the Greatest Common Divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.  
   - Example: GCD of 20 and 30 is 10

9. Count Vowels and Consonants  
   - Count how many vowels and consonants are present in a string input.  
   - Ignore special characters and digits.

10. Sort an Array using Bubble Sort  
    - Accept an array from the user and sort it in ascending order using the bubble sort technique.  
    - Keep swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

11. Perform Linear Search in Array  
    - Search for a specific number in an array using linear search.  
    - Check each element one by one until you find the target number or reach the end.
